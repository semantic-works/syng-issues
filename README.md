# SYNG - Issue Tracker

Welcome! If you're looking to report a bug in SYNG, or would like to request a feature or enhancement, this is the place for it. Please read through this document first, though.

For usage-related questions, use the [Discord server] instead.

## The issue list

Head straight to https://github.com/semantic-works/syng-issues/issues for a list of all issues or click `Issues` in the navigation bar on the almost-top.

Use [Github's reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) to vote on issues.
Simple "+1" comments with no further content will be deleted without notice.

You can also use [labels](https://github.com/semantic-works/syng-issues/labels) to filter the list of issues.

## Before creating a new issue

* Search for the issue [here](https://github.com/semantic-works/syng-issues/search?q=&type=Issues) to check if it was already reported.
* You can use labels for filtering the [issue list](https://github.com/semantic-works/syng-issues/issues) by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report or request.

## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
1.  Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
1.  Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include the following information:
      * Operating System
      * The version of SYNG that you're using
      * The platform you're using SYNG in (e.g. VS Code, or CLI)
      * The query you're trying to evaluate (you can safely redact any literals that might contain sensitive information)

Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.

1. Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a *code example* for this. That is, the JavaScript/TypeScript source code,
not just the query.
1. Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps, but prepare to answer a few questions if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs, you can also read [these guidelines](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) for bugzilla bugs.

## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
1.  Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
1.  Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
